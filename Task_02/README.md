# CodeRush: Global Offensive 

This repository contains my solution(s) for **CodeRush: Global Offensive**, a competitive programming contest hosted on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/praveshan-competitive-programming-s3). 

---

## Contest Description
Forget the usual defusal maps and hostage rescues; the battlefield is the digital realm, and the weapon is the keyboard. The bomb site? HackerRank. 

In this contest, programmers battle against rival syndicates in a world where **data is currency** and **algorithms are ammo**. 
Each solved problem is like a headshot against the competition — a defused cyber-threat in this high-stakes warzone of code. 

The goal: **solve challenging algorithmic problems as fast and efficiently as possible** to rise through the ranks and prove who’s the true *Global Elite* of competitive programming.
